Shell scripting is Linux based

Linux architecture: ASK
A - Applications
    - Applications talk to shell
S - Shell
    - On top of kernel to access the kernel
    - Shell talks to kernel
K - Kernel
    - Heart of the Linux OS
    - Kernel has C programming files (Written by Linus Torvalds)
    - Using these fies, we can create folders, do networking, manage hardware, install software
    - Do all the things which can communicate with Hardware
    - Kernel talks to hardware

We are learning shell so that we can handle kernel, using which we can automate tasks, write scripts, so on

Shell Commands:
echo - print
mkdir - create folder
ls - list directories

Shell commands in a file - Shell script

Steve Bourne: Created sh location: /bin/sh
Improvements to Bourne's shell: Bourne Again Shell: Bash location: /bin/bash
So many such shells came: csh, ksh, fish
Currently mostly used shell is: bash
